# StockSight: Stock Price Tracker & Predictor

StockSight is a Python-based application designed to track real-time stock prices and provide predictive insights using machine learning. By leveraging historical data and modern algorithms, StockSight offers users the ability to make informed decisions about stock trends. This project is an ideal starting point for anyone interested in stock market analysis, data science, and financial forecasting.

**Please Note:** While StockSight provides predictions based on historical data, the accuracy of predictions is not guaranteed. Users should exercise caution when making investment decisions.

## Features

- **Real-time Stock Tracking**: Search and view live stock prices from global markets.
- **Stock Price Predictions**: Predict future stock prices using machine learning algorithms.
- **Simple, User-Friendly Interface**: A lightweight graphical user interface (GUI) makes it easy to interact with the application.
- **Historical Data**: Visualize historical stock trends to understand past performance.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can enter a stock symbol (e.g., **AAPL** for Apple) in the provided text field. StockSight will fetch real-time data and display historical trends, as well as make predictions about future price movements. This is still a work in progress, not GUI app interface currently exists. The long term goal is to have the code run as an individual application for windows, mac, and potentially limux.

### Example:

- **Search for Stock Symbol**: Enter the ticker symbol (e.g., `TSLA` for Tesla).
- **View Real-Time Data**: The application will display the current price and basic stock information.
- **Prediction**: Based on historical data, StockSight will predict the future price trend for the selected stock.

## How It Works

### 1. **Stock Data Fetching**

StockSight uses publicly available APIs to fetch real-time and historical stock data. We use these to track the stock's daily movement, including open, high, low, and close prices.

### 2. **Prediction Model**

StockSight employs machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices. The current version uses **linear regression**, but the architecture is built to allow integration of more sophisticated models like **ARIMA**, **LSTM**, or other time series forecasting methods.

### 3. **User Interface (GUI)**

The application is built using **Tkinter**, a lightweight GUI toolkit for Python. The GUI is designed to be intuitive and minimalistic, offering a seamless user experience.

## Disclaimer

The predictions made by StockSight are based on historical data and machine learning models. **StockSight does not guarantee the accuracy of predictions.** The stock market is influenced by numerous factors, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Users should not rely solely on StockSight's predictions for making investment decisions and should always perform their own research and seek professional advice when needed.
